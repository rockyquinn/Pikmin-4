Pikmin-4
===========

A Pikmin sequel made in MonoGame. No copyright intended.

Button.cs           ~   Allows me to create a clickable button.
CollisionHandler.cs ~   Obviously handles collisions.
CollisionObject.cs  ~   All objects that have collision inherit from this
Cursor.cs           ~   Allows me to keep track of the mouse on the frame and edit the cursor's image.
Game1.cs            ~   Runs the game.
GameState.cs        ~   A temporary class allowing me to debug animations and collisions.
Pikmin.cs           ~   Allows me to create little 'Pikmin'.

Content folder holds all of the images I created for this game. The images were created using pixel art in Photoshop and are all .png.
